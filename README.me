# CDC with Debezium, Kafka, Postgres, Docker

📊 Overview
This Python script is designed to generate simulated financial transactions and insert them into a PostgreSQL database. It's particularly useful for setting up a test environment for Change Data Capture (CDC) with Debezium. The script uses the faker library to create realistic, yet fictitious, transaction data and inserts it into a PostgreSQL table.

🏗 System Architecture
![System Architecture](system_architecture.png)

🔧 Prerequisites
Before running this script, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.9+
- `psycopg2` library for Python
- `faker` library for Python
- PostgreSQL server running locally or accessible remotely
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.
- Basic understanding of Docker, Kafka, and Postgres.

💻 Installation
**Install Required Python Libraries:**
You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install psycopg2-binary faker
Services in the Compose File:

Zookeeper: A centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services.
Kafka Broker: A distributed streaming platform used for handling real-time data feeds.
Confluent Control Center: A web-based tool for managing and monitoring Apache Kafka.
Debezium: An open-source distributed platform for change data capture.
Debezium UI: A user interface for managing and monitoring Debezium connectors.
Postgres: An open-source relational database.
🚀 Getting Started

Clone the Repository: Ensure you have this Docker Compose file in your local system. If it's part of a repository, clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the Directory: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the Docker Compose file.
Run Docker Compose: Execute the following command to start all services defined in the Docker Compose file:
bash
Copy code
docker-compose up -d
This command will download the necessary Docker images, create containers, and start the services in detached mode.

Verify the Services: Check if all the services are up and running:
bash
Copy code
docker-compose ps
You should see all services listed as 'running'.

Accessing the Services:
Kafka Control Center is accessible at http://localhost:9021.
Debezium UI is accessible at http://localhost:8080.
Postgres is accessible on the default port 5432.
🛑 Shutting Down
To stop and remove the containers, networks, and volumes, run:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose down
⚙️ Customization
You can modify the Docker Compose file to suit your needs. For example, you might want to persist data in Postgres by adding a volume for the Postgres service.

🔒 Note
This setup is intended for development and testing purposes. For production environments, consider additional factors like security, scalability, and data persistence.

🎥 In this video, we dive deep into the world of Change Data Capture (CDC) and how it can be implemented for real-time data streaming using a powerful tech stack. You will use the integration of technologies like Docker, Postgres, Debezium, Kafka, Apache Spark, and Slack to create an efficient and responsive data pipeline.
